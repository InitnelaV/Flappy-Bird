The first version Flappy.py contains the skeleton with the main plot

The play loop contains a yellow square for the bird and green rectangles for the pipes

The next phase will be to enter a background, scrolling if possible, a charset for the bird (already not animated) and possibly a set for the high pipe and the low pipe

Of course have fun, the file is available for any modification
